Project Title: Examining marijuana sales relationship to crime in colorado
Team Members: Erik Thompson
Project Outline/Description: Breakdown datasets by month and county and visualize data to examine any relationships between the 2 datasets.
Research Questions: Is there a negative or positive correlation between marijuana use and particular crimes?  DUI’s? Was there a drastic change in crime data when marijuana was legalized?
Dataset(s) to be used: ’Marijuana Sales Revenue in Colorado’-From: data.colorado.gov,
                                        ‘Raw Crime Data for Denver, Colorado’-From: data.world

#Below is a dotplot of assault charges compared to marijuana sales.  With an r-value of .64, we can see that there is a strong positive correlation between disorder charges and marijuana sales.  It is unknown why this correlation exists and we cannot say that it is causative.

Final notes:  Many proponents of legal recreational marijuana have argued that it can potentially lead to a decrease in DUIs and alcohol-related crimes.  The data seems to support that, though we cannot say for sure that it is a causative relationship.
